## Currently
- Pursuing a PhD in Computer Science with a focus on Systems Security in William & Mary 
- Working as a Research Assistant in **etclab** (Extending Trust in Computing Lab)

## What I am working on?
- For my research, I am exploring how to make privacy and security automatic defaults in software systems. I aim to ensure maximum privacy protections are enabled out-of-the-box, shifting responsibility from users to the systems themselves and requiring explicit consent for any data sharing.

## What am I learning?
- Becoming comfortable with low level systems programming with Go.
- Understanding various cryptographic primitives and their usecases.
- Working with modern cryptographical libraries and implementations.
