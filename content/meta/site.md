This site is intended as a living digital gardenâ€”a space where I plant ideas, nurture thoughts, let concepts grow, and occasionally weed out what no longer serves. 

I took some inspiration in creating this site from the following excellent people and their websites: 
  - [Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs)
  - [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/)
  - [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)
  - [Michael Nielsen](http://michaelnielsen.org/)
  - [Gwern](https://gwern.net/index)
  - [Dario Amodei](https://www.darioamodei.com/)
    - This website [theme](https://github.com/GrantBirki/dario) is directly inspired from his.
